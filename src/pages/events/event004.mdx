## Technical Presentation - "Tiny ground station for LoRa satellites"
`2024 Jan 20`
`OM Diwakar VU2FFW`

The year began with the very first members’ meeting of MARS Amateur Radio Society which was 
held on Saturday, 20th Jan, 2024 at 6.15 pm IST in “The Hall of 1960”, Department of 
Chemistry, College of Engineering, Guindy campus (CEG), Anna University, Chennai.

A gathering of 35 members graced the occasion. It was heartwarming to see many senior HAMs 
gather together keeping up the spirit of the hobby despite their waning years. Of course, the 
younger generation was also represented but not as much as one might expect. Nevertheless, any 
HAM is always young at heart!

After the initial pleasantries and light refreshments, the meeting 
commenced but on a solemn note. The Secretary, OM N.Deepan - 
VU2DPN, requested Dr Shanmugham - VU2CSM to read out the 
condolence message for OM N.T.Balasubramanian – VU2DZD, who 
became silent key on 12th January 2024. Later, all the members 
stood up to observe a minutes’ silence as a mark of respect. 

Following this, the secretary called the 
President, OM Thyagu - VU2PTR, to 
preside over the meeting. The 
President greeted all the members and 
gave a brief detail of the programmes and events in the pipe line. 
Then he welcomed all the new life members and requested them to 
give a self-introduction. Subsequently, mementos were handed over 
to all the new members by the Vice President, OM Rajesh Kannan – 
VU2OW.

It was now time for the main event. OM Arun Kumar - VU2BBF 
introduced the speaker of the evening, OM Divakar – VU2FFW. 
What followed was a splendid presentation on “Tiny GS - Ground 
Station for LORA Satellites”. It was a very detailed power point 
presentation followed by an equally interesting demonstration 
including the antenna set up. At the end of the presentation, as a 
gesture of thanks, a memento was presented to OM Diwakar

Then the President informed the members 
about the proposed FOX HUNT event scheduled for 11th February. He elaborated on the rules and 
regulations to be followed and also spoke of the pre-event briefing meeting that would be 
conducted through ZOOM for the benefit of all. 

Later, OM Clement - VU2CWO invited 
everyone for the MAHAMEET Eye ball meet 
scheduled for 10th February, the 2nd 
Saturday, at Sowmiyaa Mahal, TKM Salai, 
Mahabalipuram and gave details of 
programme and process of registration.

The meeting wound up finally with the Vote 
of Thanks delivered by OM Deepan – 
VU2DPN.
