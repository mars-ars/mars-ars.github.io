## FOX Hunt
`2024 Feb 11`

The Fox Hunt - After months of planning and coordination 
the much awaited FOX HUNT was held on 11th Feb, 
Sunday. 
One of our longtime members who has a reputation of 
being an excellent fox hunter himself and an avid 
participant in every event was the designated Fox. 

The Fox howl was heard for 60 sec every 240 sec on the 
VHF frequency 145.000 MHz. The timings followed and 
power used for transmission were like this: (All times are in 
IST) 
- 08:00 to 08:25 @ 25W
- 08:30 to 09:30 @ 25W / 5W 
- 09:30 to 11:30 @ 500mW 

So, came the day and many HAMs were on the roads of 
Chennai. They had formed teams to find this fox. Cars and 
SUVs were loaded with different types of home-brewed 
antennae, signal attenuators, trackers, handies, maps and 
what-have-you's.

After a quick breakfast at some roadside eatery and a fresh 
cup of coffee, the search began earnestly. Many started off 
from the outskirts of the city.

Though the actual event officially started at 08:00am 
(0800hrs), the participants were on the road from the break 
of dawn. In fact, the outstation team from Bengaluru stayed 
overnight at a hotel and started hunting before even the fox 
had had his morning breakfast! 

The location provided was within a radius of 30km from the 
'Zero Stone' of Chennai city. 
Just imagine this scene - A car dashes through the morning 
traffic and suddenly halts on the side of the road. A few 
men come tumbling out of it holding what looked like cloth 
hangers - which in fact were antennas and direction finders - 
in one hand and a walkie talkie in the other. These men 
would jump out from the vehicle, point their strange 
devices here and there and then excitedly jump back into 
the car and drive away! 

People on the roads must have been intrigued and amused 
to see random men in civil clothes perform such actions 
which must have really looked silly to some and mysterious.

Nevertheless, after some hours of cross country driving, seven teams arrived at the fox location before 
11:30am (1130hrs). But the hunt was not over yet. Now they had to find the pups of the fox! Three of them were lost 
among the fields. The HAMs were once again on the hunt, some using imaginative and 
homebrewed searching devices to finally bring the pups to their mother. 

Finally, three teams managed to locate all the pups 
and the hunt was over.  A well deserved prize distribution ceremony was held 
and plenty of memories were captured on digital frames. VU3VWR also managed to get some great aerial videos using his drone

Many thanks to all those who 
organised the event: 
- the Event Coordinator: VU2DPN -

permissions,

was everywhere doing everything,
