## Technical Presentation - Communication during space mission
`2023 Nov 04`
`OM Kaviarasu VU2UAV`

The second important event in the quarter was the  members’ meeting of MARS Amateur Radio Society which was held on Saturday, 4th Nov, 2023 at 6.30 pm IST in the Vivekananda Hall of the P.S.High School Campus, Mylapore, Chennai. It was an august gathering that enabled many of the members to have an eye ball QSO amongst themselves and to exchange pleasantries with fellowship. 

The President, OM P.Thyagarajan - VU2PTR, welcomed the gathering and expressed his pleasure at the enthusiasm shown by the members in attending the very first meeting of the newly formed club. Subsequently, OM N.Deepan - VU2DPN requested all the members to observe a minutes’ silence as a mark of respect to OM Parthasarathy - VU2DQP and OM Durai Raj - VU2NDR who became silent key. 

The technical session followed and OM Dr. Kaviyarasu -  VU2UAV gave an excellent presentation on “Communication during Space Missions” with special reference to Chandrayaan 3 mission.
The vital role played by electronic communication in space missions and the technicalities associated with it were elegantly presented. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the talk was very pleasant and 
Dr Kaviyarasu carved a niche for himself as an able communicator and it was further proved by his polite and patient answering to questions from the members. 

Another technical session followed soon after by none other than the Digital doyen OM Balasubramanian (Bala) - VU3TBR. He had chosen the digital communication theme and also presented the “MAGIC BOX” developed by him. The deceptively simple looking gadget was demonstrated and all its capabilities were explained. From his presentation, it became clear that this gadget was a cost effective solution that would allow more HAMs to come on air especially those who could not afford expensive TRXs!

Finally, the memorable meeting came to an end with the Vote of Thanks delivered by the Secretary VU2DPN.
