## Technical Presentation - "SDR"
`2024 Mar 16`
`OM Rajesh VU2OW`

The monthly members’ meeting of MARS Amateur Radio Society for the month of Mar'24 was 
held on Saturday, 16th Mar, 2024 at 6.00 pm IST (1800hrs) in “The Hall of 1960”, Department of 
Chemistry, College of Engineering, Guindy campus (CEG), Anna University, Chennai. 
The meeting began solemnly as a 'One minute silence' was observed as a mark of respect to OM 
Dr.Venkatachalapathy - VU2PQ who became silent key on 11th Feb'24.

Then the President OM P.Thyagarajan - VU2PTR presided over the meeting and welcomed the 
gathering. In his welcome address he mentioned about the forthcoming events in the pipeline. A 
visit to the Air Traffic Control Tower of the Meenambakkam Airport and witnessing the live 
operations going on in there figured in his speech. OM Vijaya Rangan - VU2AIR shall be 
coordinating the programme and the exact date of visit shall be announced later. Another visit to 
a PCB manufacturing unit also figured in his address wherein members of MARS Amateur Radio 
Society will have an opportunity to witness the complete processing from cutting the PCB sheet to 
the shaping of a finished PCB right from its raw stage.

This was followed by a formal self introduction by the newbie HAMs/SWLs. 
The event of the day was a talk on 'Software 
Defined Radio'. OM Dr Shanmugham - 
VU2CSM called upon OM Rajesh Kannan - 
VU2OW who presented it. Contrary to the 
conventional power point presentations that 
are normally staged in a gathering, this was 
an extempore by Rajesh, though a few slides 
too found their place.

Tracing down the evolution of the SDR first, Rajesh then moved on to the 
application of SDR with special reference to QO-100 satellite and very 
elaborately explained their technical nuances. The rich experience he has 
gained in its operations reflected in his delivery. The format adopted 
might have triggered the minds of the audience and therefore many 
questions came up and Rajesh very convincingly answered all of them. At 
the end of the presentation, the Joint Secretary, OM Balashanmugham 
alias Anand - VU3UBS handed over a memento to Rajesh. 
As an addendum, the participant cup for the Fox hunt event was 
presented to OM Lakshmanan - VU2LF, as he could not collect it earlier. 
OM Vivek - VU3CDV handed over the cup to Lakshmanan on behalf of his team with OM Ravi - 
VU2ETO. 
Finally, vote of thanks was delivered by the Secretary, OM Deepan - VU2DPN.
