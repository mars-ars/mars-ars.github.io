## Technical Presentation - "Propagation"
`2024 May 25`
`OM Raghav VU3VWR`

The quarter’s members’ meeting of MARS Amateur 
Radio Society which was held on Saturday, 25th 
May, 2024 at 6.15 pm IST (1815hrs) in the 
“Vivekananda Hall” of the P.S.High School Campus, 
Mylapore, Chennai. 
After the usual formalities and pleasantries, it was 
now time for the main event. OM Arun Kumar - 
VU2BBF introduced the speaker of the evening, OM 
Raghav – VU3VWY. 

OM Raghav VU3WVY made a very informative 
presentation about Propagation. He explained the 
behaviour of radio waves as they travel through 
the various parts of the atmosphere. He narrated 
the factors which affects propagation, viz: 
reflection, refraction, absorption, diffraction, 
polarization and scattering. He then explained 
how radio waves are bent (refracted) 
by the ionosphere based on the ionization level of the layer and 
wavelength of the signal. He also added that signals with 
smaller wavelength tend to bend less and very high frequency 
and above almost never bend.

He beautifully elucidated about the various layers such as 
troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and 
finally the ionosphere which ranges from 10 kilometres to 280 
kilometres with a colourful graphical diagram and also the 
distance of the layers from earth for the “D”, “E” and “F” layers. 
He also clarified how different signals are reflected or absorbed 
by ionospheric layers at different times of the day. 

OM Raghav touched upon the concept of “Greyline” - which is 
defined as 
a line 
around the world that separates the regions 
receiving daylight and regions in darkness. He 
also told us about long and short path for Dxing. 
There was an explanation about solar indices, 
solar cycle, solar flux & sunspots and how it 
affects the communication. Finally, the 
presentation was concluded with techniques of 
earth to moon communication. The members, 
on their part, also raised very interesting 
questions and returned home with satisfying 
clarifications.
