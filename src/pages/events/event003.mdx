## Field Trip visit to Shar Sriharikota
`2023 Dec 08`

The quarter ended with a spectacular and memorable event - the one day field trip to the Sathish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota on 18th December. Thirty-six members of MARS Amateur Radio Society got a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to witness the pride of our countryâ€™s Space programme! And it was all possible because of the immeasurable efforts and perseverance of our President VU2PTR, ably coordinated by VU2DPN and VU2OW. 

The bus trip was well arranged; it was amusing to see a bunch of grown up men - some of whom were vintage class - act like schoolboys on a picnic. A brief halt at Adyar Ananda Bhavan filled our bellies with some much needed breakfast. After an hour or so, as the Space centre came into view, we were barely able to contain our excitement. 

After clearing the security formalities, we met Mr.P.Gopikrishna, Group Director from ISRO who welcomed us followed by Mr.Janardhan who introduced to us the whole setup. Then he took us into the MCC - Mission Control Centre! 

No words can describe our experience - it was awesome, jaw-dropping and mesmerising! We were allowed to sit in the chairs where the scientists, mission directors and the superstars of the Indian Space programme would sit during the launch of any satellite. We all experienced a vicarious thrill reminiscent of the time when Chandrayaan-II touched down on the moon. 

Later, we were taken around the immensely huge campus and its facilities. We were allowed to see the launch pads of the PSLVs and GSLVs. We even visited the facility where the rockets were assembled.

Finally, after a sumptuous lunch provided by SDSC and an exchange of mementos, with a heavy heart filled with unforgettable memories we all took the bus back to our homes.

Many thanks to the organisers from the MARS Amateur Radio Society and the ISRO staff for making this dream come true.
