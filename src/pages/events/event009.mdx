## VHF Net check in contest (10 days)
`2024 Aug 15`

We started off this quarter July-Sep'24 with a key event in 
the month of August - the VHF Net Check-in Contest. The 
contest was ably managed by our omnipresent VU2DPN and 
assisted by the evergreen VU2JSM. 
An overwhelming number of stations actively participated 
and checked in with competitive spirit every morning and 
evening. The number of winners this year 
increased greatly as compared to the previous year. Bravo!
